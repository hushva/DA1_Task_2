####About 
This dataset contains data on various pizza restaurants that serve margherita pizza in Hungary. 
The data presented in this table was collected via online research or direct contact with the restaurants.
We have collected observations for restaurants and recorded the values of their measured variables.
The dataset includes the restaurant ID, restaurant name, city, region, price of margherita pizza and beverage, online ratings, and more for each pizza restaurant observation.
Variables were collected by online search, primarily starting from netpincer.hu as it is already a collection of restaurants with delivery. The prices for Margherita pizza and the bevarage comes from
the menu offered online. In case of insufficient info on these we continued the search on Google and inspected the website of the restaurant directly.
Variables that were created by us are 'Region', 'Online rating', 'Pizza only'. Online rating is the average of two other ratings we found on Google and the other on netpincer.hu.

Please refer to vthe github repository for more information.
